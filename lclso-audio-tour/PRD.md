## Organization Description:

The Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo County (LCSLO) is dedicated to caring for the diverse wildlands and critical habitats of the Central Coast through conservation, restoration, and stewardship, all while connecting people to the land and one another. They manage various properties including Nipomo, where this project will be implemented.

## Problem Statement:

The LCSLO needs a new solution to provide educational audio tours at their Nipomo property. Their previous system using the "Visit" app is now obsolete, leaving visitors without access to the audio content. The property currently has interpretive signage, but LCSLO wants to enhance visitor experience through QR-based audio narration that triggers and plays an audio file when visitors scan a QR code at a POI. The user goes around the property (Kathleen’s Canyon Overlook) scanning the QR at each POI and listening to the corresponding audio.

## Project-Specific Terminology:

- POI: Points of Interest - specific locations where audio content should be triggered
- Interpretive signage: Interpretive signage refers to informational displays or signs that help visitors understand and connect with a place's natural, cultural, or historical significance. (Think of like in a zoo where each exhibit has a sign detailing about the animal)

## User Stories:

As a visitor:

- I want to scan a QR code and be taken directly to the relevant audio point page so I can learn about my location
- I want simple audio controls (play/pause) so I can easily control the narration
- I want to see a list of all audio points so I can plan my route through the park
- I want to track which points I've completed so I can ensure I don't miss any
- I want to see my overall tour progress so I know how much more there is to explore
- I want to see subtitles/transcript in addition to the audio so I can read the information at my own pace

As a developer,

- I want to view various analytics of the experience such as scan success rate, time between scan and audio play, audio playback rate, error by device type etc, so I can troubleshoot issues and provide a better user experience
